# Movie Title Generator

## Description
This project contains several js-scripts:
- credit-card-checker: Goes through lists of invalid credit card numbers and identifies companies which have issued the invalid numbers.
- message-generator: Generates awesome movie title for future Blockbuster Movies.
- mystery-organism: Creates random strings of DNA until two DNA strings have been created that will likely survive. The DNA strings are compared to each other (before and after mutations).
